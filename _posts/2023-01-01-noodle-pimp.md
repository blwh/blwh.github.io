Special thanks to Eli Silverman.

## Ingredients

* Half a packet of bacon
* Garlic, one clove
* Ginger, roughly same size as the garlic clove
* Scallions, 1-2 leeks
* Half a can of corn
* Proper dark soy sauce (more taste and less salt compared to light)

## Instructions

* Cut the bacon into slices. Start frying on a pan on medium to high heat. Get
  some colour but avoid making the bacon crispy.
* While the bacon is cooking, boil the the finely chopped garlic and ginger in
  500ml of water in a pot.
* Into the boiling water, add the flavour packet from the instant noodles and
  boil for 1-2 minutes.
* Whilst this is boiling, chop the scallions into slices.
* Break the instant noodles into 4 pieces and add to the boiling broth.
* Once the noodles are almost cooked, add the bacon and boil it with the
  noodles.
* When the noodles are cooked, add it all to a bown with the scallions and corn.
  Add soy to taste.
