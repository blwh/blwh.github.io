Carne asada is mexican grilled meat. This marinade has typical Mexican flavours, and a solid citrus taste.

## Ingredients

* 50 ml soy sauce
* 50 ml fish sauce
* juice from 3 limes
* juice from 1 orange
* 50 ml corn oil
* 4 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 tbsp chili flakes
* 50 ml chopped coriander
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1 kg flank steak

## Instructions

* Mix together all of the ingredients (except the meat) to make the marinade.
* Trim and remove silver skin and such from the meat.
* Marinade the meat for 12+ hours before cooking, grill or fry. It depends on the size of the cut, but generally 3-4 mins per side.
* If making tacos, I recommend to cut the meat into 1-2 cm slices before marinating. After cooked, slice into cubes. This leads to a more well-done product, but with more marinade flavour. It's also more practical to eat in a taco.
