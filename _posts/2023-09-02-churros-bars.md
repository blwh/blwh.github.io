Fucking great bars that are the cinnamon equivalent to brownies.

Recipe from [here](https://practicallyhomemade.com/churro-bars-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-7080).

## Ingredients

* 230 g butter
* 240 ml sugar
* 240 ml packed brown sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 520 ml flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon

### Topping

* 60 ml sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon

## Instructions

* Preheat oven to 175 degrees celsius and grease a 23x33 cm pan.
* Cream together softened butter and both sugar with a hand held mixer {or by hand}. Add eggs and vanilla, mix until everything is combined.
* Add the dry ingredients {flour, salt, baking powder and cinnamon}, mix until just combined. Pour into the prepared 9x13 pan and press into an even layer.
* Combine the topping cinnamon and sugar and mix until it is evenly incorporated. Sprinkle liberally over the top of the dough in the pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the bars are lightly browned and the middle is set.
* Let the bars cool for 30 minutes and then cut them into squares. Serve warm or at room temperature. Store in an air tight container at room temperature for up to 4 days or freeze for 3 months.
