A great cornbread that I had at IceLab.

Recipe from [here](https://www.lecremedelacrumb.com/best-super-moist-cornbread/).

## Ingredients

* 480 ml flour
* 240 ml cornmeal
* 240 ml sugar
* 1 1/2 tbsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 115 g melted butter
* 120 ml neutral oil
* 300 ml milk
* 3 large eggs

## Instructions

* Preheat oven to 175 degrees celsius and grease a 23x33 cm pan.
* In a large bowl whisk together flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
* In a medium bowl mix together butter, oil, milk, and eggs.
* Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and mix until combined.
* Transfer batter to your prepared pan. Bake for 35-45 minutes until golden and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean or with only a few crumbs (no wet batter).
* Allow to cool for 15-20 minutes in the pan before cutting into squares and serving. Serve with butter and honey if desired. Store in airtight container at room temperature up to 3 days or in the fridge for 1 week.
