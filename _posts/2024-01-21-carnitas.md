Slow cooked pork for tacos. Very nice! However, leftovers are very dry and boring, so make sure you have a strong appetite...

I wont bother writing this down since it has many steps, but [here](https://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2015/04/orange-milk-braised-pork-carnitas.html) is the recipe. Note; in Sweden you can buy "skinkstek" which works really good in this recipe!
