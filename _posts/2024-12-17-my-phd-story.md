I successfully defended my PhD thesis about a week ago. Yay me!

I have planned to write a sort of blog post about my experience as a PhD and how I planned for the defense. My experience was not perfect - it took me a long time to publish. However, in the end I managed to write some good papers. I think giving my story can be helpful for students in a similar situation, and I hope I can provide some useful tips on how to stay motivated and how to handle getting stuck with projects. For now, this acts as a placeholder to remind me to do this at a later date.

For now, take a look at [this](drlucas.phd) website my friends made for me as a dissertation present. Warning: contains many unflattering pictures of me.
