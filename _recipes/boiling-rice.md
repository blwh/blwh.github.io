I think boiling rice is a hassle, but this method from Gordon Ramsey is easy and really consistent.
From testing, this only really works in a taller pot. A shallow one will undercook the rice.

## Ingredients
* 400 grams of rice
* 1 tsp salt

## Instructions

* Wash the rice using a colander until you cant be bothered anymore (maybe a minute.)
* Add the rice and salt to your pot and 1.5x the amount of water (so 600 ml in this case.)
* Bring it quickly to a boil, mix and put lid on. Turn to low (2 on my 9 step induction stove) and leave for 10 minutes (do not open the lid!)
* Done!
