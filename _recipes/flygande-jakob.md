Flygande jakob, or flying jakob, is an award winning recipe from the 70s made by a pilot, hence the name!

## Ingredients

* Cooked rice made from 400 grams of uncooked rice
* Rotisserie chicken (about 3-4 chicken legs is enough)
* A packet of bacon
* 5 dl of whip cream
* Heinz chili sauce
* Peanuts
* (Optional) banana

## Instructions

* Preheat oven to 200 degrees.
* Cook the rice. Spread out in a baking pan (mine was about 36x26 cm.)
* Cook the bacon and cut into small pieces.
* Rip pieces of the chicken and spread it out with the bacon and peanuts on the rice.
* Whip the cream until just whipped. Mix in chili sauce with salt and pepper (here you need to taste. You should definitely taste the sauce in the cream!)
* Spread the flavoured cream evenly on everything in the pan.
* (Optional) Cut the banana into discs and layer on top of the cream.
* Put it in the oven and take out once the cream and banana is nicely browned.
