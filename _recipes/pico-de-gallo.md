Pico de gallo, or "The crow's beak", is a roughly chopped salsa. Here I give no measurements - go by feel!

## Ingredients

* Cherry tomatoes
* Yellow onion
* Garlic
* Cilantro
* Lime juice
* Neutral oil (about 1 tbsp)
* Hottest salsa you can find (about 2 tbsp)
* Salt and pepper
* (Optional) Jalapeno

## Instructions

* Finely chop all of the vegetables (including cilantro) and mix together.
* Add other ingredients to taste.
