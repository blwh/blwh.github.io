The fancy Swedish dish!

This recipe is based on the last time I did this, which was for 3 people. Scale accordingly!

### Steak

* 500g Sirloin steak
* High smoke-point oil
* salt & pepper

### Duchesse

* 1kg potato
* 3 egg yolks
* butter
* cream
* salt & pepper

### Additionals

* 2-3 tomatoes
* a packet of bacon
* 12 strands of asparagus

## instructions

* Boil the potatoes until falling apart.
* Mash the potatoes with egg yolks. Add butter, cream, salt and pepper to taste.
* Let the mash cool and turn the oven on to 250 degrees celsius.
* Roll bunches of four asparagus with two strips of bacon.
* Cook the bacon around the asparagus in a pan.
* Cut the tomatoes in halves in a fancy jagged style. Put 1-2 halves on each plank.
* Spritz the now cooled mash on the plank. Whatever style suits you.
* Take the steaks and put plenty of sea salt and pepper on both sides.
* Take a cast iron pan and put it on the stove. Get a good amount of oil on the pan and max heat until the oil is smoking.
