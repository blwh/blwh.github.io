title: Simple tuna salad
---

I don't really like tuna salad, but this turned out OK.

## Ingredients

* Two cans of tuna, water or oil (with oil, 180g per)
* 2-3 tbsp mayonnaise (Hellmans is preferred)
* One can of corn
* One bell pepper
* Four sticks of celery
* One onion (red or yellow)
* Two garlic cloves
* Dried herbs (I used parsley)
* Salt and pepper

## Instructions

* Open up and drain the tuna. Put it into a bowl.
* Chop up the vegetables to your preferred size and add to the bowl. Add the corn.
* Press the garlic cloves into the bowl. Add herbs, salt and pepper.
* Add the mayonnaise and mix.
