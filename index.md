This is the WIP homepage of its author, Lucas Hedstr√∂m. The initial idea was to
have an online CV and a way to share my public projects, but it never felt
important enough to actually bother making a website.

One day I realised I had no way of writing down recipes that was easily
available online (for me). This was obviously a bigger issue, since it made me
make this website.

- [x] Recipes (added continously)
- [x] CV
- [ ] Projects
- [x] List of publications (supplied through my CV. DRY!)
