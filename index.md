This is the WIP homepage of its author, Lucas Hedstr√∂m. The initial idea was to
have an online CV, but it never felt important enough to actually bother making
a website. Then I realised I had no way of writing down recipes that was easily
available online, which was obviously a bigger issue, since it made me make
this website.

The current roadmap;
- [x] Recipes (added continously)
- [ ] CV
- [ ] Projects (not many public ones)
- [ ] List of publications
